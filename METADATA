name: "FXdiv"
description: "Header-only library for division via fixed-point multiplication by inverse  On modern CPUs and GPUs integer division is several times slower than multiplication. FXdiv implements an algorithm to replace an integer division with a multiplication and two shifts. This algorithm improves performance when an application performs repeated divisions by the same divisor."
